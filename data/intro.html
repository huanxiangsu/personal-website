<p><span>Hi, my name is <strong>Huanxiang Su</strong>. I am an undergraduate student at <em>Portland State
            University</em> and currently pursuing Bachelor degree of Computer Science. My background on computer
        science started when I first attended university after high school graduation. Since I am pretty interesting in
        computer so I chosen computer science as my major. So far I am pretty enjoying learning CS and hoping I can
        learn more knowledge in this area, especially in programming languages and full-stack web development.
        Therefore, software engineer is my currently pursuing goal on my career.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In my leisure time, I like playing playing video games, listening to music, and watching
        TV and reality show. So in my personal website, I make a very simple music player to play some of my favorite
        songs. I also collected lots of beautiful and amazing anime images when I was young and I pretty like watching
        anime at that time, and thus I make a simple gallery page to exhibit my favorite images.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Right now, my personal interest is to learn how to develop game in both web application
        and mobile application, and I would like to learn more about Photoshop to enhance my skill in editing photos as
        well as making stuff for my application.</span></p>
